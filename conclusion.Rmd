# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

As mentioned at the beginning of this document, do check the CRAN Task View for [Web Technologies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html).  There's a lot more out there that allows you to use R with the web, and the capabilities increase all the time.  The purpose of this document was to merely give insight into some possibilities for how to use R to engage the web, with simple demonstrations or explanations of those approaches.  However, any discussed here can be taken further, and there is a great deal more to explore, so have some fun!
